## What do participants want to learn? A brief pre-workshop survey
 
In the planning phase of organizing a Software Carpentry workshop for my home 
department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry I started to wonder what do participants 
want to learn? To answer this question I designed a short survey to answer this question. 
From my small department, ~ 20% (30 people) were keen to fill out the survey and here is 
what they said:

![](fig/Q2.jpg =100)
![](fig/Q3.jpg =100)

As with most good things in life, the code for these plots can be found on Github: <URL>

I also asked survey participants to comment on any other computer programming and/or 
data science topics you would be interested in learning about. Hereâ€™s what people said 
they were interested in:

* Circos plot!!! 
* VBA (any level) 
* Processing of strings as in sequencing data would be useful
* Reproducible Research and experimental planning, ensuring that experiments are 
* well-designed, valid, reproducible and well-documented.
* Data visualization, both static and interactive
* S plus
* perl/latex
* Software to create nice figures and charts
* SAS
* Perl

My takeaway from this survey, people, well at least Molecular Biologists and Biochemists, 
are most interested in learning R or Python (and not Matlab) and that we are on track 
with the level of focus for these workshops, the majority of people are interested in 
a workshop for novices. 

Disclaimer: This is a small survey (N = 30) and from a single discipline. I would be 
very interested to hear and/or find out if these findings differ across disciplines 
and/or geography.
